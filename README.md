Data wrangling with MongoDB


Anna Signor


Data wrangling project where a large dataset from OSM was cleaned, audited, validated, shaped and prepared for MongoDB. 
The repository contains:

- a jupyter notebook showing the process, snippets of code, examples of queries and other information
- a .pdf with same information (the notebook reads and functions better)
- a sample of the XML file
- .py files with Python script used to wrangle data
